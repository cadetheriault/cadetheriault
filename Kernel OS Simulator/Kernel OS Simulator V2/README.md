The executable file was made for windows OS, because I was told during my lab session on 10/07/2022,
that the TA would prefer it to be easily executable on his windows PC. There seemed to be some
miscommunication on whether it should be made for windows or linux, so I hope this is alright !
The batch scripts are also written for windows as well!

-----
The purpose of the project was to simulate the behavior of an OS kernel structure.

The input of this project is a csv file with listed processes and attributes to its execution.
The output of the project is a csv file that displays the transitions of the processes in and out
of the states, and at what "time unit" it occured.

The two batch files: "test1.bat" and "test2.bat", will run two separate tests with the different
input test files: "test_case_1.csv" and "test_case_2.csv", and will output into two separate files:
"output_test1.csv" and "output_test2.csv".
