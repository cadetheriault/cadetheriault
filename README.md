### Hi there 👋

This GitHub repository will act as a working portfolio of some of my work.
Most of the projects displayed here will be from school projects and coding competitions, I will be adding some 
personal projects once I have worked on them more.


Here are some things to know about me:
- :books: I'm currently enrolled at Carleton University 
- :desktop_computer: I am a Fourth-year Computer Systems Engineering student
- 🏢 I have completed four four-month co-op terms with Nokia
