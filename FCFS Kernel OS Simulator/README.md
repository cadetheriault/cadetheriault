The purpose of the project was to simulate the behavior of an OS kernel structure.

The input of this project is a csv file with listed processes and attributes to its execution.
The output of the project is a csv file that displays the transitions of the processes in and out
of the states, and at what "time unit" it occured.

The two batch files: "test1.bat" and "test2.bat", will run two separate tests with the different
input test files: "test_case_1.csv" and "test_case_2.csv", and will output into two separate files:
"output_test1.csv" and "output_test2.csv".
